## 🧪 How to Test on Your Live Website:

1. **Visit your website:** (e.g., https://your-site.vercel.app)
2. **Navigate to:** Heaven → AI Doctor
3. **Try these questions:**
   - "How often should I water my monstera?"
   - "Why are my plant's leaves turning yellow?"
   - "What's the best fertilizer for succulents?"
   - "How do I get rid of spider mites?"

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Chat interface loads
- ✅ You can type messages
- ✅ AI responds within 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Responses are helpful and detailed
- ✅ Includes emojis and formatting

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If AI Doctor doesn't respond:
1. **Check backend logs** on your hosting platform
2. **Verify environment variable:**
   - Variable name: `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Value starts with: `gsk_`
3. **Redeploy** if needed
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### If you see "offline mode" messages:
- This means the fallback system is active
- The AI will still provide helpful responses
- Check that the Groq API key is set correctly

### If nothing loads:
- Check that both frontend and backend are deployed
- Verify the frontend is pointing to the correct backend URL
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
