# Seed Bank Audit - Indoor/Outdoor Classification Corrections

## Date: 2026-01-01

### Summary
Comprehensive audit of the plant seed bank to ensure no outdoor plants are incorrectly categorized as indoor plants. This is critical for accurate aptness simulation and growth predictions.

### Plants Reclassified from INDOOR to OUTDOOR (16 total):

#### Previously Corrected (Session 1):
1. **Aloe Vera** (Aloe barbadensis) - Requires direct sun, outdoor succulent
2. **Tulsi/Holy Basil** (Ocimum tenuiflorum) - Needs high sun, tropical outdoor
3. **Curry Leaf** (Murraya koenigii) - Small tree requiring direct sunlight

#### Newly Corrected (This Session):
4. **Bird of Paradise** (Strelitzia reginae) - Requires 3000+ Lux, grows 5-6 feet
5. **Croton** (Codiaeum variegatum) - Tropical shrub needing full sun for vibrant colors
6. **Coleus** (Plectranthus scutellarioides) - Annual/perennial outdoor plant
7. **Asparagus Fern** (Asparagus setaceus) - Outdoor plant in warm climates
8. **Foxtail Fern** (Asparagus densiflorus) - Outdoor ornamental plant
9. **Rubber Plant** (Ficus elastica) - Grows into large trees outdoors (15-25m)
10. **Monstera** (Monstera deliciosa) - Massive tropical vine, outdoor climber
11. **Weeping Fig** (Ficus benjamina) - Becomes a tree outdoors
12. **Dragon Tree** (Dracaena draco) - Outdoor in warm/tropical climates
13. **Norfolk Island Pine** (Araucaria heterophylla) - Large outdoor conifer tree
14. **Agave (Century Plant)** (Agave americana) - Desert outdoor succulent
15. **Queen Victoria Agave** (Agave victoriae-reginae) - Compact desert plant
16. **Ponytail Palm** (Beaucarnea recurvata) - Outdoor succulent tree
17. **Ponytail Palm (Variegated)** - Same as above, variegated variety
18. **Spineless Yucca** (Yucca elephantipes) - Outdoor desert plant
19. **Banana Croton** (Codiaeum) - Tropical outdoor shrub
20. **Mammy Croton** (Codiaeum) - Tropical outdoor shrub
21. **Fiddle Leaf Fig** (Ficus lyrata) - Can grow into large trees outdoors
22. **Sago Palm** (Cycas revoluta) - Outdoor cycad, not a true palm
23. **Yucca Cane** (Yucca gigantea) - Outdoor desert plant
24. **Staghorn Fern** (Platycerium) - Outdoor epiphyte in tropical climates

### Botanical Reasoning:

**Light Requirements:**
- Plants requiring >2000 Lux or "full sun" cannot thrive long-term indoors
- Indoor lighting typically provides 100-1500 Lux maximum

**Size Considerations:**
- Plants that naturally grow into trees (Ficus, Norfolk Pine) need outdoor space
- Mature size indicates outdoor classification

**Climate Needs:**
- Desert plants (Agave, Yucca) need outdoor conditions
- Tropical vines (Monstera) need outdoor humidity and space

### Verification:
All remaining "indoor" plants have been verified to be true indoor species that:
- Tolerate low to medium light (100-1500 Lux)
- Remain compact in size
- Thrive in typical indoor temperature/humidity ranges
- Do not require full sun exposure

### Impact on Aptness Simulation:
These corrections ensure that:
1. Outdoor plants are scored against outdoor environmental data
2. Indoor plants are scored for indoor growing conditions
3. Growth predictions are biologically accurate
4. Users receive correct recommendations for their space type
